# Georgia Tech's Scientific Software Engineering center

This Github repository is the central location for public resources developed by [Georgia Tech's SSE center](https://ssecenter.cc.gatech.edu/). Please check our pinned repositories for more details on best practices and resources for software engineering of scientific applications.

The Scientific Software Engineering (SSE) Center at Georgia Tech is a new effort that is part of the [Virtual Institute for Scientific Software (VISS)](https://www.schmidtfutures.com/our-work/virtual-institute-for-scientific-software/). VISS was launched by Schmidt Futures to address the need for training and educating software engineers, and the SSE center at Georgia Tech is focused on developing new methodologies for improving high-performance scientific codes and for training tomorrowâ€™s software engineers.

We are currently hiring the core team for this effort, so please check back in the near future for additional information.
